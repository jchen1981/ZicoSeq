# ZicoSeq beta version
ZicoSeq is a permutation-based framework for differential abundance analysis of Zero-inflated Compositional Sequencing data such as microbiome data. Currently, it has the following components:

**Winsorization** to decrease the influence of outliers

**Posterior sampling** to impute zeros based on a beta mixture prior  

**Multiple-stage normalization** to address compositional effects

**An omnibus test** to address diverse taxa-covariate relationships

**Permutation-based FDR control** to address taxa correlations and multiple testing
